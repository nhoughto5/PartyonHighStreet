In particular do\n\t     * not attempt to use any RxJS implementation details to create Observers - you don't need them. Remember also\n\t     * that your object does not have to implement all methods. If you find yourself creating a method that doesn't\n\t     * do anything, you can simply omit it. Note however, that if `error` method is not provided, all errors will\n\t     * be left uncaught.\n\t     *\n\t     * The second way is to give up on Observer object altogether and simply provide callback functions in place of its methods.\n\t     * This means you can provide three functions as arguments to `subscribe`, where first function is equivalent\n\t     * of a `next` method, second of an `error` method and third of a `complete` method. Just as in case of Observer,\n\t     * if you do not need to listen for something, you can omit a function, preferably by passing `undefined` or `null`,\n\t     * since `subscribe` recognizes these functions by where they were placed in function call. When it comes\n\t     * to `error` function, just as before, if not provided, errors emitted by an Observable will be thrown.\n\t     *\n\t     * Whatever style of calling `subscribe` you use, in both cases it returns a Subscription object.\n\t     * This object allows you to call `unsubscribe` on it, which in turn will stop work that an Observable does and will clean\n\t     * up all resources that an Observable used.

This is done by subscribing to each Observable in order and,\n\t * whenever any Observable emits, collecting an array of the most recent\n\t * values from each Observable. So if you pass `n` Observables to operator,\n\t * returned Observable will always emit an array of `n` values, in order\n\t * corresponding to order of passed Observables (value from the first Observable\n\t * on the first place and so on).\n\t *\n\t * Static version of `combineLatest` accepts either an array of Observables\n\t * or each Observable can be put directly as an argument. Note that array of\n\t * Observables is good choice, if you don't know beforehand how many Observables\n\t * you will combine. Passing empty array will result in Observable that\n\t * completes immediately.\n\t *\n\t * To ensure output array has always the same length, `combineLatest` will\n\t * actually wait for all input Observables to emit at least once,\n\t * before it starts emitting results. This means if some Observable emits\n\t * values before other Observables started emitting, all that values but last\n\t * will be lost. On the other hand, is some Observable does not emit value but\n\t * completes, resulting Observable will complete at the same moment without\n\t * emitting anything, since it will be now impossible to include value from\n\t * completed Observable in resulting array. Also, if some input Observable does\n\t * not emit any value and never completes, `combineLatest` will also never emit\n\t * and never complete, since, again, it will wait for all streams to emit some\n\t * value.\n\t *\n\t * If at least one Observable was passed to `combineLatest` and all passed Observables\n\t * emitted something, resulting Observable will complete when all combined\n\t * streams complete. So even if some Observable completes, result of\n\t * `combineLatest` will still emit values when other Observables do. In case\n\t * of completed Observable, its value from now on will always be the last\n\t * emitted value. On the other hand, if any Observable errors, `combineLatest`\n\t * will error immediately as well, and all other Observables will be unsubscribed.\n\t *\n\t * `combineLatest` accepts as optional parameter `project` function, which takes\n\t * as arguments all values that would normally be emitted by resulting Observable.\n\t * `project` can return any kind of value, which will be then emitted by Observable\n\t * instead of default array. Note that `project` does not take as argument that array\n\t * of values, but values themselves. That means default `project` can be imagined\n\t * as function that takes all its arguments and puts them into an array.\n\t *\n\t *\n\t * @example <caption>Combine two timer Observables</caption>\n\t * const firstTimer = Rx.Observable.timer(0, 1000);

It might be useful, if you do not have control over\n\t * internal scheduler of a given Observable, but want to control when its values are emitted nevertheless.\n\t *\n\t * Returned Observable emits the same notifications (nexted values, complete and error events) as the source Observable,\n\t * but rescheduled with provided scheduler. Note that this doesn't mean that source Observables internal\n\t * scheduler will be replaced in any way. Original scheduler still will be used, but when the source Observable emits\n\t * notification, it will be immediately scheduled again - this time with scheduler passed to `observeOn`.\n\t * An anti-pattern would be calling `observeOn` on Observable that emits lots of values synchronously, to split\n\t * that emissions into asynchronous chunks. For this to happen, scheduler would have to be passed into the source\n\t * Observable directly (usually into the operator that creates it). `observeOn` simply delays notifications a\n\t * little bit more, to ensure that they are emitted at expected moments.\n\t *\n\t * As a matter of fact, `observeOn` accepts second parameter, which specifies in milliseconds with what delay notifications\n\t * will be emitted. The main difference between {@link delay} operator and `observeOn` is that `observeOn`\n\t * will delay all notifications - including error notifications - while `delay` will pass through error\n\t * from source Observable immediately when it is emitted.

For example, boxShadow has values like \"10px 10px 20px 30px rgb(255,0,0)\" which would utterly confuse other plugins. This method allows us to split that data apart and grab only the numeric data and attach it to uniquely-named properties of a generic proxy object ({}) so that we can feed that to virtually any plugin to have the numbers tweened. However, we must also keep track of which properties from the proxy go with which CSSPropTween values and instances. So we create a linked list of MiniPropTweens. Each one records a target (the original CSSPropTween), property (like \"s\" or \"xn1\" or \"xn2\") that we're tweening and the unique property name that was used for the proxy (like \"boxShadow_xn1\" and \"boxShadow_xn2\") and whether or not they need to be rounded. That way, in the _setPluginRatio() method we can simply copy the values over from the proxy to the CSSPropTween instance(s). Then, when the main CSSPlugin setRatio() method runs and applies the CSSPropTween values accordingly, they're updated nicely. So the external plugin tweens the numbers, _setPluginRatio() copies them over, and setRatio() acts normally, applying css-specific values to the element.\n\t\t\t\t * This method returns an object that has the following properties:\n\t\t\t\t *  - proxy: a generic object containing the starting values for all the properties that will be tweened by the external plugin.

These instances store important information like the target, property, starting value, amount of change, etc. They can also optionally have a number of \"extra\" strings and numeric values named xs1, xn1, xs2, xn2, xs3, xn3, etc. where \"s\" indicates string and \"n\" indicates number. These can be pieced together in a complex-value tween (type:1) that has alternating types of data like a string, number, string, number, etc. For example, boxShadow could be \"5px 5px 8px rgb(102, 102, 51)\". In that value, there are 6 numbers that may need to tween and then pieced back together into a string again with spaces, suffixes, etc. xs0 is special in that it stores the suffix for standard (type:0) tweens, -OR- the first string (prefix) in a complex-value (type:1) CSSPropTween -OR- it can be the non-tweening value in a type:-1 CSSPropTween. We do this to conserve memory.\n\t\t\t\t * CSSPropTweens have the following optional properties as well (not defined through the constructor):\n\t\t\t\t *  - l: Length in terms of the number of extra properties that the CSSPropTween has (default: 0). For example, for a boxShadow we may need to tween 5 numbers in which case l would be 5; Keep in mind that the start/end values for the first number that's tweened are always stored in the s and c properties to conserve memory. All additional values thereafter are stored in xn1, xn2, etc.\n\t\t\t\t *  - xfirst: The first instance of any sub-CSSPropTweens that are tweening properties of this instance. For example, we may split up a boxShadow tween so that there's a main CSSPropTween of type:1 that has various xs* and xn* values associated with the h-shadow, v-shadow, blur, color, etc. Then we spawn a CSSPropTween for each of those that has a higher priority and runs BEFORE the main CSSPropTween so that the values are all set by the time it needs to re-assemble them. The xfirst gives us an easy way to identify the first one in that chain which typically ends at the main one (because they're all prepende to the linked list)\n\t\t\t\t *  - plugin: The TweenPlugin instance that will handle the tweening of any complex values. For example, sometimes we don't want to use normal subtweens (like xfirst refers to) to tween the values - we might want ThrowPropsPlugin or BezierPlugin some other plugin to do the actual tweening, so we create a plugin instance and store a reference here. We need this reference so that if we get a request to round values or disable a tween, we can pass along that request.\n\t\t\t\t *  - data: Arbitrary data that needs to be stored with the CSSPropTween. Typically if we're going to have a plugin handle the tweening of a complex-value tween, we create a generic object that stores the END values that we're tweening to and the CSSPropTween's xs1, xs2, etc. have the starting values. We store that object as data. That way, we can simply pass that object to the plugin and use the CSSPropTween as the target.\n\t\t\t\t *  - setRatio: Only used for type:2 tweens that require custom functionality. In this case, we call the CSSPropTween's setRatio() method and pass the ratio each time the tween updates. This isn't quite as efficient as doing things directly in the CSSPlugin's setRatio() method, but it's very convenient and flexible.\n\t\t\t\t * @param {!Object} t Target object whose property will be tweened. Often a DOM element, but not always. It could be anything.\n\t\t\t\t * @param {string} p Property to tween (name). For example, to tween element.width, p would be \"width\".\n\t\t\t\t * @param {number} s Starting numeric value\n\t\t\t\t * @param {number} c Change in numeric value over the course of the entire tween. For example, if element.width starts at 5 and should end at 100, c would be 95.\n\t\t\t\t * @param {CSSPropTween=} next The next CSSPropTween in the linked list. If one is defined, we will define its _prev as the new instance, and the new instance's _next will be pointed at it.\n\t\t\t\t * @param {number=} type The type of CSSPropTween where -1 = a non-tweening value, 0 = a standard simple tween, 1 = a complex value (like one that has multiple numbers in a comma- or space-delimited string like border:\"1px solid red\"), and 2 = one that uses a custom setRatio function that does all of the work of applying the values on each update.\n\t\t\t\t * @param {string=} n Name of the property that should be used for overwriting purposes which is typically the same as p but not always. For example, we may need to create a subtween for the 2nd part of a \"clip:rect(...)\" tween in which case \"p\" might be xs1 but \"n\" is still \"clip\"\n\t\t\t\t * @param {boolean=} r If true, the value(s) should be rounded\n\t\t\t\t * @param {number=} pr Priority in the linked list order.

The reason this functionality is\n\t\t\t * wrapped into a separate static method of CSSPlugin instead of being integrated into all regular className tweens\n\t\t\t * is because it creates entirely new tweens that may have completely different targets than the original tween,\n\t\t\t * so if they were all lumped into the original tween instance, it would be inconsistent with the rest of the API\n\t\t\t * and it would create other problems. For example:\n\t\t\t *  - If I create a tween of elementA, that tween instance may suddenly change its target to include 50 other elements (unintuitive if I specifically defined the target I wanted)\n\t\t\t *  - We can't just create new independent tweens because otherwise, what happens if the original/parent tween is reversed or pause or dropped into a TimelineLite for tight control? You'd expect that tween's behavior to affect all the others.\n\t\t\t *  - Analyzing every style property of every child before and after the tween is an expensive operation when there are many children, so this behavior shouldn't be imposed on all className tweens by default, especially since it's probably rare that this extra functionality is needed.\n\t\t\t *\n\t\t\t * @param {Object} target object to be tweened\n\t\t\t * @param {number} Duration in seconds (or frames for frames-based tweens)\n\t\t\t * @param {Object} Object containing the end values, like {className:\"newClass\", ease:Linear.easeNone}\n\t\t\t * @return {Array} An array of TweenLite instances\n\t\t\t */\n\t\t\tCSSPlugin.cascadeTo = function(target, duration, vars) {\n\t\t\t\tvar tween = TweenLite.to(target, duration, vars),\n\t\t\t\t\tresults = [tween],\n\t\t\t\t\tb = [],\n\t\t\t\t\te = [],\n\t\t\t\t\ttargets = [],\n\t\t\t\t\t_reservedProps = TweenLite._internals.reservedProps,\n\t\t\t\t\ti, difs, p, from;\n\t\t\t\ttarget = tween._targets || tween.target;\n\t\t\t\t_getChildStyles(target, b, targets);\n\t\t\t\ttween.render(duration, true, true);\n\t\t\t\t_getChildStyles(target, e);\n\t\t\t\ttween.render(0, true, true);\n\t\t\t\ttween._enabled(true);\n\t\t\t\ti = targets.length;\n\t\t\t\twhile (--i > -1) {\n\t\t\t\t\tdifs = _cssDif(targets[i], b[i], e[i]);\n\t\t\t\t\tif (difs.firstMPT) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\tdifs = difs.difs;\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor (p in vars) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tif (_reservedProps[p]) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdifs[p] = vars[p];\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom = {};\n\t\t\t\t\t\tfor (p in difs) {\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfrom[p] = b[i][p];\n\t\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t\t\tresults.push(TweenLite.fromTo(targets[i], duration, from, difs));\n\t\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\t}\n\t\t\t\treturn results;\n\t\t\t};\n\t\n\t\t\tTweenPlugin.activate([CSSPlugin]);\n\t\t\treturn CSSPlugin;\n\t\n\t\t}, true);\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t/*\n\t * ----------------------------------------------------------------\n\t * RoundPropsPlugin\n\t * ----------------------------------------------------------------\n\t */\n\t\t(function() {\n\t\n\t\t\tvar RoundPropsPlugin = _gsScope._gsDefine.plugin({\n\t\t\t\t\tpropName: \"roundProps\",\n\t\t\t\t\tversion: \"1.6.0\",\n\t\t\t\t\tpriority: -1,\n\t\t\t\t\tAPI: 2,\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\t//called when the tween renders for the first time.

The input is a function `func` with some parameters, the\n\t * last parameter must be a callback function that `func` calls when it is\n\t * done.\n\t *\n\t * The output of `bindCallback` is a function that takes the same parameters\n\t * as `func`, except the last one (the callback). When the output function\n\t * is called with arguments it will return an Observable. If function `func`\n\t * calls its callback with one argument the Observable will emit that value.\n\t * If on the other hand the callback is called with multiple values the resulting\n\t * Observable will emit an array with said values as arguments.\n\t *\n\t * It is very important to remember that input function `func` is not called\n\t * when the output function is, but rather when the Observable returned by the output\n\t * function is subscribed. This means if `func` makes an AJAX request, that request\n\t * will be made every time someone subscribes to the resulting Observable, but not before.\n\t *\n\t * The last optional parameter - {@link Scheduler} - can be used to control when the call\n\t * to `func` happens after someone subscribes to Observable, as well as when results\n\t * passed to callback will be emitted. By default, the subscription to  an Observable calls `func`\n\t * synchronously, but using `Scheduler.async` as the last parameter will defer the call to `func`,\n\t * just like wrapping the call in `setTimeout` with a timeout of `0` would. If you use the async Scheduler\n\t * and call `subscribe` on the output Observable all function calls that are currently executing\n\t * will end before `func` is invoked.\n\t *\n\t * By default results passed to the callback are emitted immediately after `func` invokes the callback.\n\t * In particular, if the callback is called synchronously the subscription of the resulting Observable\n\t * will call the `next` function synchronously as well.  If you want to defer that call,\n\t * you may use `Scheduler.async` just as before.  This means that by using `Scheduler.async` you can\n\t * ensure that `func` always calls its callback asynchronously, thus avoiding terrifying Zalgo.\n\t *\n\t * Note that the Observable created by the output function will always emit a single value\n\t * and then complete immediately. If `func` calls the callback multiple times, values from subsequent\n\t * calls will not appear in the stream. If you need to listen for multiple calls,\n\t *  you probably want to use {@link fromEvent} or {@link fromEventPattern} instead.\n\t *\n\t * If `func` depends on some context (`this` property) and is not already bound the context of `func`\n\t * will be the context that the output function has at call time. In particular, if `func`\n\t * is called as a method of some objec and if `func` is not already bound, in order to preserve the context\n\t * it is recommended that the context of the output function is set to that object as well.\n\t *\n\t * If the input function calls its callback in the \"node style\" (i.e. first argument to callback is\n\t * optional error parameter signaling whether the call failed or not), {@link bindNodeCallback}\n\t * provides convenient error handling and probably is a better choice.\n\t * `bindCallback` will treat such functions the same as any other and error parameters\n\t * (whether passed or not) will always be interpreted as regular callback argument.\n\t *\n\t *\n\t * @example <caption>Convert jQuery's getJSON to an Observable API</caption>\n\t * // Suppose we have jQuery.getJSON('/my/url', callback)\n\t * var getJSONAsObservable = bindCallback(jQuery.getJSON);\n\t * var result = getJSONAsObservable('/my/url');\n\t * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x), e => console.error(e));\n\t *\n\t *\n\t * @example <caption>Receive an array of arguments passed to a callback</caption>\n\t * someFunction((a, b, c) => {\n\t *   console.log(a); // 5\n\t *   console.log(b); // 'some string'\n\t *   console.log(c); // {someProperty: 'someValue'}\n\t * });\n\t *\n\t * const boundSomeFunction = bindCallback(someFunction);\n\t * boundSomeFunction().subscribe(values => {\n\t *   console.log(values) // [5, 'some string', {someProperty: 'someValue'}]\n\t * });\n\t *\n\t *\n\t * @example <caption>Compare behaviour with and without async Scheduler</caption>\n\t * function iCallMyCallbackSynchronously(cb) {\n\t *   cb();\n\t * }\n\t *\n\t * const boundSyncFn = bindCallback(iCallMyCallbackSynchronously);\n\t * const boundAsyncFn = bindCallback(iCallMyCallbackSynchronously, null, Rx.Scheduler.async);\n\t *\n\t * boundSyncFn().subscribe(() => console.log('I was sync!'));\n\t * boundAsyncFn().subscribe(() => console.log('I was async!'));\n\t * console.log('This happened...');\n\t *\n\t * // Logs:\n\t * // I was sync!\n\t * // This happened...\n\t * // I was async!\n\t *\n\t *\n\t * @example <caption>Use bindCallback on an object method</caption>\n\t * const boundMethod = bindCallback(someObject.methodWithCallback);\n\t * boundMethod.call(someObject) // make sure methodWithCallback has access to someObject\n\t * .subscribe(subscriber);\n\t *\n\t *\n\t * @see {@link bindNodeCallback}\n\t * @see {@link from}\n\t * @see {@link fromPromise}\n\t *\n\t * @param {function} func A function with a callback as the last parameter.\n\t * @param {Scheduler} [scheduler] The scheduler on which to schedule the\n\t * callbacks.\n\t * @return {function(...params: *): Observable} A function which returns the\n\t * Observable that delivers the same values the callback would deliver.\n\t * @name bindCallback\n\t */\n\tfunction bindCallback(callbackFunc, resultSelector, scheduler) {\n\t    if (resultSelector) {\n\t        if (isScheduler_1.isScheduler(resultSelector)) {\n\t            scheduler = resultSelector;\n\t        }\n\t        else {\n\t            // DEPRECATED PATH\n\t            return function () {\n\t                var args = [];\n\t                for (var _i = 0; _i < arguments.length; _i++) {\n\t                    args[_i] = arguments[_i];\n\t                }\n\t                return bindCallback(callbackFunc, scheduler).apply(void 0, args).pipe(map_1.map(function (args) { return isArray_1.isArray(args) ?

If there are more parameters (third and so on),\n\t * Observable will emit an array with all arguments, except first error argument.\n\t *\n\t * Note that `func` will not be called at the same time output function is,\n\t * but rather whenever resulting Observable is subscribed. By default call to\n\t * `func` will happen synchronously after subscription, but that can be changed\n\t * with proper {@link Scheduler} provided as optional third parameter. Scheduler\n\t * can also control when values from callback will be emitted by Observable.\n\t * To find out more, check out documentation for {@link bindCallback}, where\n\t * Scheduler works exactly the same.\n\t *\n\t * As in {@link bindCallback}, context (`this` property) of input function will be set to context\n\t * of returned function, when it is called.\n\t *\n\t * After Observable emits value, it will complete immediately. This means\n\t * even if `func` calls callback again, values from second and consecutive\n\t * calls will never appear on the stream. If you need to handle functions\n\t * that call callbacks multiple times, check out {@link fromEvent} or\n\t * {@link fromEventPattern} instead.\n\t *\n\t * Note that `bindNodeCallback` can be used in non-Node.js environments as well.\n\t * \"Node.js-style\" callbacks are just a convention, so if you write for\n\t * browsers or any other environment and API you use implements that callback style,\n\t * `bindNodeCallback` can be safely used on that API functions as well.\n\t *\n\t * Remember that Error object passed to callback does not have to be an instance\n\t * of JavaScript built-in `Error` object. In fact, it does not even have to an object.\n\t * Error parameter of callback function is interpreted as \"present\", when value\n\t * of that parameter is truthy. It could be, for example, non-zero number, non-empty\n\t * string or boolean `true`. In all of these cases resulting Observable would error\n\t * with that value. This means usually regular style callbacks will fail very often when\n\t * `bindNodeCallback` is used. If your Observable errors much more often then you\n\t * would expect, check if callback really is called in Node.js-style and, if not,\n\t * switch to {@link bindCallback} instead.\n\t *\n\t * Note that even if error parameter is technically present in callback, but its value\n\t * is falsy, it still won't appear in array emitted by Observable.\n\t *\n\t *\n\t * @example <caption>Read a file from the filesystem and get the data as an Observable</caption>\n\t * import * as fs from 'fs';\n\t * var readFileAsObservable = bindNodeCallback(fs.readFile);\n\t * var result = readFileAsObservable('./roadNames.txt', 'utf8');\n\t * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x), e => console.error(e));\n\t *\n\t *\n\t * @example <caption>Use on function calling callback with multiple arguments</caption>\n\t * someFunction((err, a, b) => {\n\t *   console.log(err); // null\n\t *   console.log(a); // 5\n\t *   console.log(b); // \"some string\"\n\t * });\n\t * var boundSomeFunction = bindNodeCallback(someFunction);\n\t * boundSomeFunction()\n\t * .subscribe(value => {\n\t *   console.log(value); // [5, \"some string\"]\n\t * });\n\t *\n\t * @example <caption>Use on function calling callback in regular style</caption>\n\t * someFunction(a => {\n\t *   console.log(a); // 5\n\t * });\n\t * var boundSomeFunction = bindNodeCallback(someFunction);\n\t * boundSomeFunction()\n\t * .subscribe(\n\t *   value => {}             // never gets called\n\t *   err => console.log(err) // 5\n\t * );\n\t *\n\t *\n\t * @see {@link bindCallback}\n\t * @see {@link from}\n\t * @see {@link fromPromise}\n\t *\n\t * @param {function} func Function with a Node.js-style callback as the last parameter.\n\t * @param {Scheduler} [scheduler] The scheduler on which to schedule the\n\t * callbacks.\n\t * @return {function(...params: *): Observable} A function which returns the\n\t * Observable that delivers the same values the Node.js callback would\n\t * deliver.\n\t * @name bindNodeCallback\n\t */\n\tfunction bindNodeCallback(callbackFunc, resultSelector, scheduler) {\n\t    if (resultSelector) {\n\t        if (isScheduler_1.isScheduler(resultSelector)) {\n\t            scheduler = resultSelector;\n\t        }\n\t        else {\n\t            // DEPRECATED PATH\n\t            return function () {\n\t                var args = [];\n\t                for (var _i = 0; _i < arguments.length; _i++) {\n\t                    args[_i] = arguments[_i];\n\t                }\n\t                return bindNodeCallback(callbackFunc, scheduler).apply(void 0, args).pipe(map_1.map(function (args) { return isArray_1.isArray(args) ?

That means `forkJoin` will\n\t * not emit more than once and it will complete after that. If you need to emit combined values not only\n\t * at the end of lifecycle of passed Observables, but also throughout it, try out {@link combineLatest}\n\t * or {@link zip} instead.\n\t *\n\t * In order for resulting array to have the same length as the number of input Observables, whenever any of\n\t * that Observables completes without emitting any value, `forkJoin` will complete at that moment as well\n\t * and it will not emit anything either, even if it already has some last values from other Observables.\n\t * Conversely, if there is an Observable that never completes, `forkJoin` will never complete as well,\n\t * unless at any point some other Observable completes without emitting value, which brings us back to\n\t * the previous case.

You can achieve this in two\n     * following ways.\n     *\n     * The first way is creating an object that implements {@link Observer} interface. It should have methods\n     * defined by that interface, but note that it should be just a regular JavaScript object, which you can create\n     * yourself in any way you want (ES6 class, classic function constructor, object literal etc.). In particular do\n     * not attempt to use any RxJS implementation details to create Observers - you don't need them. Remember also\n     * that your object does not have to implement all methods. If you find yourself creating a method that doesn't\n     * do anything, you can simply omit it. Note however, that if `error` method is not provided, all errors will\n     * be left uncaught.\n     *\n     * The second way is to give up on Observer object altogether and simply provide callback functions in place of its methods.\n     * This means you can provide three functions as arguments to `subscribe`, where first function is equivalent\n     * of a `next` method, second of an `error` method and third of a `complete` method. Just as in case of Observer,\n     * if you do not need to listen for something, you can omit a function, preferably by passing `undefined` or `null`,\n     * since `subscribe` recognizes these functions by where they were placed in function call. When it comes\n     * to `error` function, just as before, if not provided, errors emitted by an Observable will be thrown.\n     *\n     * Whatever style of calling `subscribe` you use, in both cases it returns a Subscription object.\n     * This object allows you to call `unsubscribe` on it, which in turn will stop work that an Observable does and will clean\n     * up all resources that an Observable used. Note that cancelling a subscription will not call `complete` callback\n     * provided to `subscribe` function, which is reserved for a regular completion signal that comes from an Observable.\n     *\n     * Remember that callbacks provided to `subscribe` are not guaranteed to be called asynchronously.\n     * It is an Observable itself that decides when these functions will be called. For example {@link of}\n     * by default emits all its values synchronously.

You can pass either an array of\n * Observables, or put them directly as arguments. Passing an empty array will result\n * in Observable that completes immediately.\n *\n * `concat` will subscribe to first input Observable and emit all its values, without\n * changing or affecting them in any way.

When last input Observable completes,\n * `concat` will complete as well. At any given moment only one Observable passed to operator\n * emits values. If you would like to emit values from passed Observables concurrently, check out\n * {@link merge} instead, especially with optional `concurrent` parameter. As a matter of fact,\n * `concat` is an equivalent of `merge` operator with `concurrent` parameter set to `1`.\n *\n * Note that if some input Observable never completes, `concat` will also never complete\n * and Observables following the one that did not complete will never be subscribed.

Observables that would be subscribed after\n * the one that emitted error, never will.\n *\n * If you pass to `concat` the same Observable many times, its stream of values\n * will be \"replayed\" on every subscription, which means you can repeat given Observable\n * as many times as you like.

This is done by subscribing to each Observable in order and,\n * whenever any Observable emits, collecting an array of the most recent\n * values from each Observable. So if you pass `n` Observables to operator,\n * returned Observable will always emit an array of `n` values, in order\n * corresponding to order of passed Observables (value from the first Observable\n * on the first place and so on).\n *\n * Static version of `combineLatest` accepts either an array of Observables\n * or each Observable can be put directly as an argument. Note that array of\n * Observables is good choice, if you don't know beforehand how many Observables\n * you will combine. Passing empty array will result in Observable that\n * completes immediately.\n *\n * To ensure output array has always the same length, `combineLatest` will\n * actually wait for all input Observables to emit at least once,\n * before it starts emitting results. This means if some Observable emits\n * values before other Observables started emitting, all that values but last\n * will be lost. On the other hand, is some Observable does not emit value but\n * completes, resulting Observable will complete at the same moment without\n * emitting anything, since it will be now impossible to include value from\n * completed Observable in resulting array. Also, if some input Observable does\n * not emit any value and never completes, `combineLatest` will also never emit\n * and never complete, since, again, it will wait for all streams to emit some\n * value.\n *\n * If at least one Observable was passed to `combineLatest` and all passed Observables\n * emitted something, resulting Observable will complete when all combined\n * streams complete. So even if some Observable completes, result of\n * `combineLatest` will still emit values when other Observables do. In case\n * of completed Observable, its value from now on will always be the last\n * emitted value. On the other hand, if any Observable errors, `combineLatest`\n * will error immediately as well, and all other Observables will be unsubscribed.\n *\n * `combineLatest` accepts as optional parameter `project` function, which takes\n * as arguments all values that would normally be emitted by resulting Observable.\n * `project` can return any kind of value, which will be then emitted by Observable\n * instead of default array. Note that `project` does not take as argument that array\n * of values, but values themselves. That means default `project` can be imagined\n * as function that takes all its arguments and puts them into an array.\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Combine two timer Observables</caption>\n * const firstTimer = Rx.Observable.timer(0, 1000);

It might be useful, if you do not have control over\n * internal scheduler of a given Observable, but want to control when its values are emitted nevertheless.\n *\n * Returned Observable emits the same notifications (nexted values, complete and error events) as the source Observable,\n * but rescheduled with provided scheduler. Note that this doesn't mean that source Observables internal\n * scheduler will be replaced in any way. Original scheduler still will be used, but when the source Observable emits\n * notification, it will be immediately scheduled again - this time with scheduler passed to `observeOn`.\n * An anti-pattern would be calling `observeOn` on Observable that emits lots of values synchronously, to split\n * that emissions into asynchronous chunks. For this to happen, scheduler would have to be passed into the source\n * Observable directly (usually into the operator that creates it). `observeOn` simply delays notifications a\n * little bit more, to ensure that they are emitted at expected moments.\n *\n * As a matter of fact, `observeOn` accepts second parameter, which specifies in milliseconds with what delay notifications\n * will be emitted.

For example, boxShadow has values like \"10px 10px 20px 30px rgb(255,0,0)\" which would utterly confuse other plugins. This method allows us to split that data apart and grab only the numeric data and attach it to uniquely-named properties of a generic proxy object ({}) so that we can feed that to virtually any plugin to have the numbers tweened. However, we must also keep track of which properties from the proxy go with which CSSPropTween values and instances. So we create a linked list of MiniPropTweens. Each one records a target (the original CSSPropTween), property (like \"s\" or \"xn1\" or \"xn2\") that we're tweening and the unique property name that was used for the proxy (like \"boxShadow_xn1\" and \"boxShadow_xn2\") and whether or not they need to be rounded. That way, in the _setPluginRatio() method we can simply copy the values over from the proxy to the CSSPropTween instance(s). Then, when the main CSSPlugin setRatio() method runs and applies the CSSPropTween values accordingly, they're updated nicely. So the external plugin tweens the numbers, _setPluginRatio() copies them over, and setRatio() acts normally, applying css-specific values to the element.\n\t\t\t * This method returns an object that has the following properties:\n\t\t\t *  - proxy: a generic object containing the starting values for all the properties that will be tweened by the external plugin.

These instances store important information like the target, property, starting value, amount of change, etc. They can also optionally have a number of \"extra\" strings and numeric values named xs1, xn1, xs2, xn2, xs3, xn3, etc. where \"s\" indicates string and \"n\" indicates number. These can be pieced together in a complex-value tween (type:1) that has alternating types of data like a string, number, string, number, etc. For example, boxShadow could be \"5px 5px 8px rgb(102, 102, 51)\". In that value, there are 6 numbers that may need to tween and then pieced back together into a string again with spaces, suffixes, etc. xs0 is special in that it stores the suffix for standard (type:0) tweens, -OR- the first string (prefix) in a complex-value (type:1) CSSPropTween -OR- it can be the non-tweening value in a type:-1 CSSPropTween. We do this to conserve memory.\n\t\t\t * CSSPropTweens have the following optional properties as well (not defined through the constructor):\n\t\t\t *  - l: Length in terms of the number of extra properties that the CSSPropTween has (default: 0). For example, for a boxShadow we may need to tween 5 numbers in which case l would be 5; Keep in mind that the start/end values for the first number that's tweened are always stored in the s and c properties to conserve memory. All additional values thereafter are stored in xn1, xn2, etc.\n\t\t\t *  - xfirst: The first instance of any sub-CSSPropTweens that are tweening properties of this instance. For example, we may split up a boxShadow tween so that there's a main CSSPropTween of type:1 that has various xs* and xn* values associated with the h-shadow, v-shadow, blur, color, etc. Then we spawn a CSSPropTween for each of those that has a higher priority and runs BEFORE the main CSSPropTween so that the values are all set by the time it needs to re-assemble them. The xfirst gives us an easy way to identify the first one in that chain which typically ends at the main one (because they're all prepende to the linked list)\n\t\t\t *  - plugin: The TweenPlugin instance that will handle the tweening of any complex values. For example, sometimes we don't want to use normal subtweens (like xfirst refers to) to tween the values - we might want ThrowPropsPlugin or BezierPlugin some other plugin to do the actual tweening, so we create a plugin instance and store a reference here. We need this reference so that if we get a request to round values or disable a tween, we can pass along that request.\n\t\t\t *  - data: Arbitrary data that needs to be stored with the CSSPropTween. Typically if we're going to have a plugin handle the tweening of a complex-value tween, we create a generic object that stores the END values that we're tweening to and the CSSPropTween's xs1, xs2, etc. have the starting values. We store that object as data. That way, we can simply pass that object to the plugin and use the CSSPropTween as the target.\n\t\t\t *  - setRatio: Only used for type:2 tweens that require custom functionality. In this case, we call the CSSPropTween's setRatio() method and pass the ratio each time the tween updates. This isn't quite as efficient as doing things directly in the CSSPlugin's setRatio() method, but it's very convenient and flexible.\n\t\t\t * @param {!Object} t Target object whose property will be tweened. Often a DOM element, but not always. It could be anything.\n\t\t\t * @param {string} p Property to tween (name). For example, to tween element.width, p would be \"width\".\n\t\t\t * @param {number} s Starting numeric value\n\t\t\t * @param {number} c Change in numeric value over the course of the entire tween. For example, if element.width starts at 5 and should end at 100, c would be 95.\n\t\t\t * @param {CSSPropTween=} next The next CSSPropTween in the linked list. If one is defined, we will define its _prev as the new instance, and the new instance's _next will be pointed at it.\n\t\t\t * @param {number=} type The type of CSSPropTween where -1 = a non-tweening value, 0 = a standard simple tween, 1 = a complex value (like one that has multiple numbers in a comma- or space-delimited string like border:\"1px solid red\"), and 2 = one that uses a custom setRatio function that does all of the work of applying the values on each update.\n\t\t\t * @param {string=} n Name of the property that should be used for overwriting purposes which is typically the same as p but not always. For example, we may need to create a subtween for the 2nd part of a \"clip:rect(...)\" tween in which case \"p\" might be xs1 but \"n\" is still \"clip\"\n\t\t\t * @param {boolean=} r If true, the value(s) should be rounded\n\t\t\t * @param {number=} pr Priority in the linked list order.

The input is a function `func` with some parameters, the\n * last parameter must be a callback function that `func` calls when it is\n * done.\n *\n * The output of `bindCallback` is a function that takes the same parameters\n * as `func`, except the last one (the callback). When the output function\n * is called with arguments it will return an Observable. If function `func`\n * calls its callback with one argument the Observable will emit that value.\n * If on the other hand the callback is called with multiple values the resulting\n * Observable will emit an array with said values as arguments.\n *\n * It is very important to remember that input function `func` is not called\n * when the output function is, but rather when the Observable returned by the output\n * function is subscribed. This means if `func` makes an AJAX request, that request\n * will be made every time someone subscribes to the resulting Observable, but not before.\n *\n * The last optional parameter - {@link Scheduler} - can be used to control when the call\n * to `func` happens after someone subscribes to Observable, as well as when results\n * passed to callback will be emitted. By default, the subscription to  an Observable calls `func`\n * synchronously, but using `Scheduler.async` as the last parameter will defer the call to `func`,\n * just like wrapping the call in `setTimeout` with a timeout of `0` would. If you use the async Scheduler\n * and call `subscribe` on the output Observable all function calls that are currently executing\n * will end before `func` is invoked.\n *\n * By default results passed to the callback are emitted immediately after `func` invokes the callback.\n * In particular, if the callback is called synchronously the subscription of the resulting Observable\n * will call the `next` function synchronously as well.  If you want to defer that call,\n * you may use `Scheduler.async` just as before.  This means that by using `Scheduler.async` you can\n * ensure that `func` always calls its callback asynchronously, thus avoiding terrifying Zalgo.\n *\n * Note that the Observable created by the output function will always emit a single value\n * and then complete immediately. If `func` calls the callback multiple times, values from subsequent\n * calls will not appear in the stream. If you need to listen for multiple calls,\n *  you probably want to use {@link fromEvent} or {@link fromEventPattern} instead.\n *\n * If `func` depends on some context (`this` property) and is not already bound the context of `func`\n * will be the context that the output function has at call time. In particular, if `func`\n * is called as a method of some objec and if `func` is not already bound, in order to preserve the context\n * it is recommended that the context of the output function is set to that object as well.\n *\n * If the input function calls its callback in the \"node style\" (i.e. first argument to callback is\n * optional error parameter signaling whether the call failed or not), {@link bindNodeCallback}\n * provides convenient error handling and probably is a better choice.\n * `bindCallback` will treat such functions the same as any other and error parameters\n * (whether passed or not) will always be interpreted as regular callback argument.\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Convert jQuery's getJSON to an Observable API</caption>\n * // Suppose we have jQuery.getJSON('/my/url', callback)\n * var getJSONAsObservable = bindCallback(jQuery.getJSON);\n * var result = getJSONAsObservable('/my/url');\n * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x), e => console.error(e));\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Receive an array of arguments passed to a callback</caption>\n * someFunction((a, b, c) => {\n *   console.log(a); // 5\n *   console.log(b); // 'some string'\n *   console.log(c); // {someProperty: 'someValue'}\n * });\n *\n * const boundSomeFunction = bindCallback(someFunction);\n * boundSomeFunction().subscribe(values => {\n *   console.log(values) // [5, 'some string', {someProperty: 'someValue'}]\n * });\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Compare behaviour with and without async Scheduler</caption>\n * function iCallMyCallbackSynchronously(cb) {\n *   cb();\n * }\n *\n * const boundSyncFn = bindCallback(iCallMyCallbackSynchronously);\n * const boundAsyncFn = bindCallback(iCallMyCallbackSynchronously, null, Rx.Scheduler.async);\n *\n * boundSyncFn().subscribe(() => console.log('I was sync!'));\n * boundAsyncFn().subscribe(() => console.log('I was async!'));\n * console.log('This happened...');\n *\n * // Logs:\n * // I was sync!\n * // This happened...\n * // I was async!\n *\n *\n * @example <caption>Use bindCallback on an object method</caption>\n * const boundMethod = bindCallback(someObject.methodWithCallback);\n * boundMethod.call(someObject) // make sure methodWithCallback has access to someObject\n * .subscribe(subscriber);\n *\n *\n * @see {@link bindNodeCallback}\n * @see {@link from}\n * @see {@link fromPromise}\n *\n * @param {function} func A function with a callback as the last parameter.\n * @param {Scheduler} [scheduler] The scheduler on which to schedule the\n * callbacks.\n * @return {function(...params: *): Observable} A function which returns the\n * Observable that delivers the same values the callback would deliver.\n * @name bindCallback\n */\nfunction bindCallback(callbackFunc, resultSelector, scheduler) {\n    if (resultSelector) {\n        if (isScheduler_1.isScheduler(resultSelector)) {\n            scheduler = resultSelector;\n        }\n        else {\n            // DEPRECATED PATH\n            return function () {\n                var args = [];\n                for (var _i = 0; _i < arguments.length; _i++) {\n                    args[_i] = arguments[_i];\n                }\n                return bindCallback(callbackFunc, scheduler).apply(void 0, args).pipe(map_1.map(function (args) { return isArray_1.isArray(args) ?
