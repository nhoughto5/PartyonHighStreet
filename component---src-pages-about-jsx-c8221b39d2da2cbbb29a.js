After years of self teaching, he attended the Selkirk College Music program in Nelson B.C. There he lived in a magical musical party house on High St. After jamming relentlessly with his housemates, he decided that they should start a band, named after the High St vibe. Shortly after, Brin met Trav and joined the band, and after college, moved to Victoria B.C. And after 10 years of summer touring, festivals, shows, recording and spreading the funk around the world, The Party is rocking more than ever!
